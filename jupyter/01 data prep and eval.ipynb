Introduction\\nAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease (ND) and the char-\\nacteristics of AD include cognitive deﬁcit and memory loss that can eventually disrupt the\\nmotor system, visuospatial orientation, speech, and behavior [1,2]. Several neuropathologi-\\ncal hallmarks of AD including inﬂammation, intracellular neuroﬁbrillary tangles (NFTs),\\nand extracellular Aβ deposits have already been well identiﬁed [3–5]. Tau proteins and\\ndeposits of Aβ peptides are detected in different brain areas, which can further lead to\\nmicroglial activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic dysfunction, and even neuronal\\ncell death [6,7]. Characteristics of AD-related inﬂammation include reactive microglia\\naround Aβ plaques, which preserve an inﬂammatory state via releasing various proinﬂam-\\nmatory mediators, which can ultimately lead to neuronal loss. In the case of AD, reactive\\ngliosis histology indicates the aberrant morphology and proliferation of microglia and as-\\ntrocytes. It has been reported that astrogliosis and microgliosis are common characteristics\\nof numerous NDs with different causes [8–10], however it was not certain whether these\\nhistopathological alterations reﬂect an inconsequential, harmful, or beneﬁcial function of\\nglial cells in the neurodegenerative process. Unfortunately, currently available drugs can\\nonly provide symptomatic treatment of AD (Table 1), instead of curing or preventing this\\ndevastating disease.\\nMicroglia play role as the resident immune cells of the central nervous system\\n(CNS) [11,12].\\nSelf-renewal and homeostasis of microglia is maintained via various\\nfactors, such as macrophage-colony stimulating factor and transforming growth factor\\nMolecules 2022, 27, 4124. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27134124\\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules'"

Microglia play crucial roles in CNS tissue maintenance, pathogen defense,\\nand injury response [16,17]. In addition, they play roles in the developmental sculpting\\nof neural circuits via engulﬁng and removing unwanted synapses and neurons [18,19].\\nMicroglia have multifaceted roles in the course of AD because of their various phenotypes\\nand a range of activation pathways. After pathological stimulation, extremely branched\\nmicroglia have the capacity to alter to an amoeboid form [20,21]. In aging brains, microglia\\nhave reduced level of branching that decreases their capacity of surveillance, which can\\nfurther lead to impaired homeostatic functions [22–24]. In diseased brains, morphology\\nof microglia differs owing to the spatial location and AD stage. Amyloid plaque-linked\\nmicroglia also go through dramatic and morphological alterations, while plaque-distant\\nmicroglia exhibit minor alterations over time [25]. As compared to the brains at earlier\\nAD stages, microglia in Braak stage V–VI brains possess more intense morphological alter-\\nations [26]. The progressive variety in microglial structure may take place because of the\\nduration and intensity of the pathological environment [27], however this may also take\\nplace because of the differences in responses of microglia to different stimuli including tau\\nor Aβ aggregation [28]. It has been reported that dystrophic microglia emergence precedes\\ntau pathology development [29,30].\\nSoluble form of hyperphosphorylated tau may trigger the phenotypic alteration in\\nmicroglia, which can further cause loss of immunosurveillance activity and mediate AD\\nprogression via the formation of NFTs [26]. Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest that pheno-\\ntypic alterations in microglia including behavior, proteomic signatures, and morphology\\nare linked with AD progression [31,32]. It has been revealed that M1 microglia secrete\\nvarious inﬂammatory chemokines and cytokines, which can result in neuronal death and\\ninﬂammation (Figure 1) [33], whereas tissue repair and maintenance are linked with alterna-\\ntive M2 microglial activation [34]. In addition, M2 microglia mediate neuroprotection and\\nanti-inﬂammatory effects, whereas M1 microglia mediate neurotoxicity and inﬂammation.\\nIndeed, both of these phenotypes play roles in the NDs, thus microglia have the capacity to\\nplay role as a double-edged sword in NDs [35]. Therefore, precise regulation of microglia\\nactivation is important for the normal activity of microglia to prevent NDs and maintain\\nbrain homoeostasis [36].\\nFigure 1. Schematic description of M1 and M2 polarization of microglia and their immunoregulatory\\nfunctions.\\nIn AD mice, parabiosis studies showed that microglia are responsible for the elevated\\nlevel of myeloid cells found in brains containing plaque pathology, along with the negligible\\nimpact of inﬁltrating macrophages [37]. In this review, we have highlighted the molecular Molecules 2022, 27, 4124\\n3 of 19\\npathogenesis of AD, microglial functions in the adult brain, the effect of microglia in\\nthe aging brain, and the effect of microglia in AD. Furthermore, we have focused on\\nthe importance of targeting microglia for AD treatment.

Characteristics of AD-related inﬂammation include reactive microglia around Aβ plaques, which preserve an inﬂammatory state via releasing various proinﬂammatory mediators, which can ultimately lead to neuronal loss. In the case of AD, reactive gliosis histology indicates the aberrant morphology and proliferation of microglia and astrocytes. It has been reported that astrogliosis and microgliosis are common characteristics of numerous NDs with different causes , however it was not certain whether these histopathological alterations reﬂect an inconsequential, harmful, or beneﬁcial function of glial cells in the neurodegenerative process. Unfortunately, currently available drugs can only provide symptomatic treatment of AD (Table 1), instead of curing or preventing this devastating disease. Microglia play role as the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) . Self-renewal and homeostasis of microglia is maintained via various factors, such as macrophage-colony stimulating factor and transforming growth factor Molecules 2022, 27, 4124. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27134124 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules Molecules 2022, 27, 4124 2 of 19 signaling . Microglia play crucial roles in CNS tissue maintenance, pathogen defense, and injury response . In addition, they play roles in the developmental sculpting of neural circuits via engulﬁng and removing unwanted synapses and neurons . Microglia have multifaceted roles in the course of AD because of their various phenotypes and a range of activation pathways. After pathological stimulation, extremely branched microglia have the capacity to alter to an amoeboid form . In aging brains, microglia have reduced level of branching that decreases their capacity of surveillance, which can further lead to impaired homeostatic functions . In diseased brains, morphology of microglia differs owing to the spatial location and AD stage. Amyloid plaque-linked microglia also go through dramatic and morphological alterations, while plaque-distant microglia exhibit minor alterations over time . As compared to the brains at earlier AD stages, microglia in Braak stage V–VI brains possess more intense morphological alterations . The progressive variety in microglial structure may take place because of the duration and intensity of the pathological environment , however this may also take place because of the differences in responses of microglia to different stimuli including tau or Aβ aggregation . It has been reported that dystrophic microglia emergence precedes tau pathology development . Soluble form of hyperphosphorylated tau may trigger the phenotypic alteration in microglia, which can further cause loss of immunosurveillance activity and mediate AD progression via the formation of NFTs . Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest that phenotypic alterations in microglia including behavior, proteomic signatures, and morphology are linked with AD progression . It has been revealed that M1 microglia secrete various inﬂammatory chemokines and cytokines, which can result in neuronal death and inﬂammation (Figure 1) , whereas tissue repair and maintenance are linked with alternative M2 microglial activation . In addition, M2 microglia mediate neuroprotection and anti-inﬂammatory effects, whereas M1 microglia mediate neurotoxicity and inﬂammation. Indeed, both of these phenotypes play roles in the NDs, thus microglia have the capacity to play role as a double-edged sword in NDs . Therefore, precise regulation of microglia activation is important for the normal activity of microglia to prevent NDs and maintain brain homoeostasis . Figure 1. Schematic description of M1 and M2 polarization of microglia and their immunoregulatory functions. In AD mice, parabiosis studies showed that microglia are responsible for the elevated level of myeloid cells found in brains containing plaque pathology, along with the negligible impact of inﬁltrating macrophages . In this review, we have highlighted the molecular Molecules 2022, 27, 4124 3 of 19 pathogenesis of AD, microglial functions in the adult brain, the effect of microglia in the aging brain, and the effect of microglia in AD. Furthermore, we have focused on the importance of targeting microglia for AD treatment. Information for the review was gathered from a variety of sources and databases, including Science Direct, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus. Several keywords were utilized in this study, including Microglia, Alzheimer’s disease, amyloid-beta, brain, Aβ plaques, tau protein, neuroinﬂammation, therapeutics, CSF1R, immunoreceptors, etc. The data were gathered from manuscripts, theses, books, book chapters, conference proceedings, and other publications published till 202  CONCLUSIONS: , instead of targeting the underlying mechanisms associated with AD. Therefore, there is a strong need for treatment options that can interact with the mechanisms of AD pathogenesis and slow down its advancement. Neuroinﬂammation is one such downstream target, which is a cause instead of a consequence of neurodegeneration. Mechanisms that are linked with AD pathogenesis are highly complex and microglia are the key neuroinﬂammation modulators. In addition, microglia have a signiﬁcant contribution in triggering synaptic dysfunction and loss; however, the precise and exact mechanisms are yet to be fully revealed. Thus, better knowledge regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the microglia–synapse interaction is required on an urgent basis for the development of novel anti-AD therapies. Moreover, more studies are required regarding whether or not the prevention of microgliamediated removal of synapses decreases cognitive deﬁcits and averts neurodegeneration.'"

       "'ABSTRACT: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common, progressive, and devastating neurodegenerative disorder that mainly affects the elderly. Microglial dysregulation, amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, and intracellular neuroﬁbrillary tangles play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of AD. In the brain, microglia play roles as immune cells to provide protection against virus injuries and diseases. They have signiﬁcant contributions in the development of the brain, cognition, homeostasis of the brain, and plasticity. Multiple studies have conﬁrmed that uncontrolled microglial function can result in impaired microglial mitophagy, induced Aβ accumulation and tau pathology, and a chronic neuroinﬂammatory environment. In the brain, most of the genes that are associated with AD risk are highly expressed by microglia. Although it was initially regarded that microglia reaction is incidental and induced by dystrophic neurites and Aβ plaques'"

Althafar', 'subject': 'Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common, progressive, and devastating neurodegenerative disorder that mainly affects the elderly. Microglial dysregulation, amyloid-beta (A) plaques, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of AD. In the brain, microglia play roles as immune cells to provide protection against virus injuries and diseases. They have significant contributions in the development of the brain, cognition, homeostasis of the brain, and plasticity. Multiple studies have confirmed that uncontrolled microglial function can result in impaired microglial mitophagy, induced A accumulation and tau pathology, and a chronic neuroinflammatory environment. In the brain, most of the genes that are associated with AD risk are highly expressed by microglia. Although it was initially regarded that microglia reaction is incidental and induced by dystrophic neurites and A plaques. Nonetheless, it has been reported by genome-wide association studies that most of the risk loci for AD are located in genes that are occasionally uniquely and highly expressed in microglia. This finding further suggests that microglia play significant roles in early AD stages and they be targeted for the development of novel therapeutics. In this review, we have summarized the molecular pathogenesis of AD, microglial activities in the adult brain, the role of microglia in the aging brain, and the role of microglia in AD. We have also particularly focused on the significance of targeting microglia for the treatment of AD.', 'keywords': 'Alzheimer’s disease; pathogenesis; microglia; amyloid-beta; tau; neuroinflammation', 'moddate': '2022-06-28T08:27:41+02:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20220628082741+02'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20220628140532+08'00'\", 'page': 0}, page_content='. The data were gathered from manuscripts,theses, books, book chapters, conference proceedings, and other publications publishedtill 202CONCLUSIONS:, instead oftargeting the underlying mechanisms associated with AD. Therefore, there is a strong needfor treatment options that can interact with the mechanisms of AD pathogenesis and slowdown its advancement. Neuroinﬂammation is one such downstream target, which is acause instead of a consequence of neurodegeneration. Mechanisms that are linked with ADpathogenesis are highly complex and microglia are the key neuroinﬂammation modulators.In addition, microglia have a signiﬁcant contribution in triggering synaptic dysfunction andloss; however, the precise and exact mechanisms are yet to be fully revealed')"
